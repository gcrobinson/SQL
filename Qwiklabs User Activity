--Using Qwiklabs for my SQL inquiries, I'll be working on the MariaDB Shell to identify which employee devices require updates. 
--Additionally, I'll be examining user login activity to detect any signs of unusual behavior.


#1. I need to obtain information on employee devices because my team needs to update them.
SELECT *
FROM machines;
--The output returns all the contents of the machines table:

+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------------+-------------+
| device_id    | operating_system | email_client   | OS_patch_date | employee_id |
+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------------+-------------+
| a184b775c707 | OS 1             | Email Client 1 | 2021-09-01    |        1156 |
| a192b174c940 | OS 2             | Email Client 1 | 2021-06-01    |        1052 |
| a305b818c708 | OS 3             | Email Client 2 | 2021-06-01    |        1182 |
| a317b635c465 | OS 1             | Email Client 2 | 2021-03-01    |        1130 |
| a320b137c219 | OS 2             | Email Client 2 | 2021-03-01    |        1000 |
|...           |                  |                |               |             |



#2. Here we are focused on the email client 2 who is running various devices. 
SELECT device_id, email_client
FROM machines;
+--------------+----------------+
| device_id    | email_client   |
+--------------+----------------+
| a184b775c707 | Email Client 1 |
| a192b174c940 | Email Client 1 |
| a305b818c708 | Email Client 2 |
| a317b635c465 | Email Client 2 |
| a320b137c219 | Email Client 2 |



#3. I need information on the operating systems used on various devices and their last patch date.
SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date
FROM machines;
--Outut:
+--------------+------------------+---------------+
| device_id    | operating_system | OS_patch_date |
+--------------+------------------+---------------+
| a184b775c707 | OS 1             | 2021-09-01    |
| a192b174c940 | OS 2             | 2021-06-01    |
| a305b818c708 | OS 3             | 2021-06-01    |
| a317b635c465 | OS 1             | 2021-03-01    |
| a320b137c219 | OS 2             | 2021-03-01    |


#4. I need to investigate the locations where login attempts were made to ensure that theyâ€™re in expected areas (the United States, Canada, or Mexico).
SELECT event_id, country
FROM log_in_attempts;

--Output:
+----------+---------+
| event_id | country |
+----------+---------+
|        1 | CAN     |
|        2 | CAN     |
|        3 | USA     |
|        4 | USA     |
|        5 | CANADA  |
|        6 | MEXICO  |
|        7 | CAN     |
|        8 | US      |
|        9 | MEX     |


#5. I need to check if login attempts were made outside of the organization's working hours.
SELECT username, login_date, login_time
FROM log_in_attempts;
--Output:
+----------+------------+------------+
| username | login_date | login_time |
+----------+------------+------------+
| jrafael  | 2022-05-09 | 04:56:27   |
| apatel   | 2022-05-10 | 20:27:27   |
| dkot     | 2022-05-09 | 06:47:41   |
| dkot     | 2022-05-08 | 02:00:39   |
| jrafael  | 2022-05-11 | 03:05:59   |


#6. Lastly, I need to further organize the previous results by ordering them by login date and login time.
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, login_time;
--Output:
+----------+----------+------------+------------+---------+-----------------+---------+
| event_id | username | login_date | login_time | country | ip_address      | success |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+---------+-----------------+---------+
|      117 | bsand    | 2022-05-08 | 00:19:11   | USA     | 192.168.197.187 |       0 |
|       92 | pwashing | 2022-05-08 | 00:36:12   | US      | 192.168.247.219 |       0 |
|        8 | bisles   | 2022-05-08 | 01:30:17   | US      | 192.168.119.173 |       0 |
|        4 | dkot     | 2022-05-08 | 02:00:39   | USA     | 192.168.178.71  |       0

--In summary I have gathered information from the machines and login_attempts tables in the organization database to determine which employee devices must be updated. 
I also have information needed to collect data on user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred.
